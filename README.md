# VBA_Stock_Analysis
### VBA Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to use the VBA macros on Excel to perform analysis on stock dataset. I learned how to create arrays, use loops, run macros, and display result in Excel. By using macros we are able to save time and allow the Excel to calculate the requested analysis. Macros are a efficient tool to help provide solutions/analysis. 

## Result

The 2017 stock analysis result was outstanding. Only one stock failed to make profit which was TERP. The highest performing stock was DQ with return of 199.4%.
